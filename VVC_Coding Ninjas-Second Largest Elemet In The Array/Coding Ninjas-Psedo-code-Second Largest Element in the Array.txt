You have been given an array ‘a’ of ‘n’ unique non-negative integers.

Find the second largest element from the array.

Return the second largest element.

Sample Input 1 :
{3, 4, 5, 2}

output:
4

Sample Input 2:
{4, 5, 3, 6, 7}

output:
6

Psedo code 1:
1. In the main function, Create an array containing integers.

2. Define a function named getSecondLargestElements that takes an array of integers as input
function getSecondLargestElements(array):

3. Set the largest and second largest values found so far to the smallest possible integer value
    largest = smallest possible integer value
    second largest = smallest possible integer value

4. Iterate through each element in the array to find the largest value
    for each element in array:
        // If the current element is greater than the current largest value
        if element is greater than largest:
            // Update the largest value to the current element
            largest = element


5. Iterate through each element in the array again to find the second largest value
    for each element in array:
        // If the current element is smaller than the largest value and greater than the current second largest value
        if element is smaller than largest and greater than second largest:
            // Update the second largest value to the current element
            second largest = element


6. Return the second largest value found in the array
    return second largest


7. Call the getSecondLargestElements function with the array as input and print the result
    print getSecondLargestElements(array)


Psedo code 2:

1. In the main function, Create an array containing integers.

2. Define a function named getSecondLargestElements that takes an array of integers as input
function getSecondLargestElements(array):

3. Set the largest and second largest values found so far to the smallest possible integer value
    largest = smallest possible integer value
    second largest = smallest possible integer value

4.  Iterate through each element in the array
    for each element in array:
        // If the current element is greater than the current largest value
        if element is greater than largest:
            // Update the second largest value to the current largest value
            // Update the largest value to the current element
            secLargest = largest
            largest = element
        // Else If the current element is smaller than the largest value and greater than the current second largest value
        else if element is smaller than largest and greater than second largest:
            // Update the second largest value to the current element
            secLargest = element


6. Return the second largest value found in the array
    return second largest


7. Call the getSecondLargestElements function with the array as input and print the result
    print getSecondLargestElements(array)
