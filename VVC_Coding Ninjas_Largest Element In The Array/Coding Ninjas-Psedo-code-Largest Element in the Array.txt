Given an array 'arr' of size 'n' find the largest element in the array.

The first line will contain a single integer 'n', the size of the array 'arr'

The second line will contain 'n' integers representing the array elements. That is arr.length.

Print the maximum of elements.

Sample input 1:
n = 6
arr = {4, 7, 8, 6, 7, 6}
output: 8

Sample input 2:
n = 8
arr = {5, 9, 3, 4, 8, 4, 3, 10}
output: 10

Pseudo code:
1. Create an array.

2. Define a function named largestElement that takes an array of integers as input.

3.Set the maximum value found so far to the smallest possible integer value. That is Integer.MIN_VALUE.

4. Iterate through each element in the array using for loop.

5. Check If the current element is greater than the current maximum value.

6. Then Update the maximum value to the current element.

7. Return the maximum value found in the array.

8. Call the largestElement function with the array as input and print the result.
