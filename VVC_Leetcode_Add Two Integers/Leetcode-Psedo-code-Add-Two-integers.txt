Given two integers num1 and num2, return the sum of the two integers.

Example 1:
Input: num1 = 12, num2 = 5
Output: 17
Explanation: num1 is 12, num2 is 5, and their sum is 12 + 5 = 17, so 17 is returned.

Example 2:
Input: num1 = -10, num2 = 4
Output: -6
Explanation: num1 + num2 = -6, so -6 is returned.

Pseudo code:
1. Set the value of num1 variable to 12 and set the value of num2 variable to 5 in the main function.

2. Define a function called 'sum' that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.

3. Call the 'sum' function with num1 and num2 as arguments, and store the result in variable 'c'.

4. Print the value of 'c'
